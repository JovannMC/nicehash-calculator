# nicehash-calculator
A Python script to grab daily average earnings from NiceHash's profitability calculator API from the specified hardware<br>
<br>

## About
It makes calls to multiple NiceHash API endpoints and the script attempts to figure out the daily average earnings from them, being as close to the NiceHash calculator as possible.<br>
This still needs a lot of testing since I need to figure out how exactly NiceHash actually calculates the earnings for the website, and can be pretty inaccurate depending on the earnings.<br>
<br>
## Arguments
`--debug` - prints out debug messages and logs the endpoint responses in a `/logs` folder
